What do i want to talk about?

Intro
==============

Timeline - How did things go down?

Motivation:
- A lot has been written about the PCSTP, but there are two problems:
- 1. Articles are short and shallow. Many of the reoccurring methods are only
     proven four citations deep.
- 2. It is difficult to get an overview of what _exactly_ has been done. Problems are
     restated, methods reused. (example: dhea solver).

PCSTP
==============

What it is?

What did we look at?

What are the main points?
- Preprocessing is a big deal.
- Heuristics are aplenty.
- Directed graph versions of the PCSTP are preferable.

Curiosities:
- 

Other Problems
=============

Prize-Collecting Tours
-------------

Median Problems
-------------


MTP
=============

Motivation:

- Some of the methods seen for the PCSTP are not particularly problem specific.
- Can we make use of them in some other way.
- /Reading all day makes William a sad fellow/





Important lessons about the PCSTP:


Reflections
=============

The Survey
-------------
Shouldn't have approached each major topic in the same way:
- Heuristics need a more shallow approach.
- The GW algorithm is diffcult, but important. There should be more handholding.

Overall:
- Spend more time with a wider perspective.
- Focus more on application.

The Solver / The Median Tree Problem
-------------
- Using the Python interface was fun, but was a crutch later on.
- Spend more time on preprocessing.
- ...
- Decide on a "product" earlier.
- Focus more on application. OR is most fun when solving real problems?

Creating a solver is a good exercise, but without applications, is it still useful?
