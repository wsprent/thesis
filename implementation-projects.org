Incumbent
==================
Use Gurobi's Python API to determine whether state of the art general MIP solvers can compete with custom,
problem specific methods.

Try:
1. Solve the PCSTP with just Lazy Constraints. Separate integer GSECs by DFS to find cycles.
2. Add LP relaxation cuts to the above using max flow.
3. Either piggyback on the preprocessing routines of SCIP-Jack or DIY.


Quick List
==================

1. Preprocessing comparison

2. SCIP-Jack vs. Cplex/Gurobi Implementation

3. Something with the GW algorithm

4. Exact solution to Quota/Budget problems

5. Cplex/Gurobi NW vs. GW optimisation problem

6. Exact solution to the Profitable Tour Problem
