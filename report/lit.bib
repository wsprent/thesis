abstract="We study the version of the prize collecting traveling salesman problem, where the objective is to find a tour that visits a subset of vertices such that the length of the tour plus the sum of penalties associated with vertices not in the tour is as small as possible. We present an approximation algorithm with constant bound. The algorithm is based on Christofides' algorithm for the traveling salesman problem as well as a method to round fractional solutions of a linear programming relaxation to integers, feasible for the original problem.",

abstract="The prize-collecting Steiner tree problem on a graph with edge costs and vertex profits asks for a subtree minimizing the sum of the total cost of all edges in the subtree plus the total profit of all vertices not contained in the subtree. For this well-known problem we develop a new algorithmic framework consisting of three main parts:",
