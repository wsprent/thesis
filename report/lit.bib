abstract="We study the version of the prize collecting traveling salesman problem, where the objective is to find a tour that visits a subset of vertices such that the length of the tour plus the sum of penalties associated with vertices not in the tour is as small as possible. We present an approximation algorithm with constant bound. The algorithm is based on Christofides' algorithm for the traveling salesman problem as well as a method to round fractional solutions of a linear programming relaxation to integers, feasible for the original problem.",

abstract = "In this paper we give some integer programming formulations for the Steiner tree problem on undirected and directed graphs and study the associated polyhedra. We give some families of facets for the undirected case along with some compositions and extensions. We also give a projection that relates the Steiner tree polyhedron on an undirected graph to the polyhedron for the corresponding directed graph. This is used to show that the LP-relaxation of the directed formulation is superior to the LP-relaxation of the undirected one.",
