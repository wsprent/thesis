\chapter{Solving the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem}
\label{chap:solving}

In this chapter, we will present a survey of the methods used to solve the \gls{pcstp}. Due to the nature of solving
NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problems, this involves the mixing and matching of methods within larger frameworks.
 After a rundown of the history of solving the \gls{pcstp} in section \ref{sec:solving:history}, we will delve deeper into a subset of the methods used to solve the \gls{pcstp} to varying degrees:
\begin{itemize}
\item Section~\ref{sec:solving:pre} presents preprocessing algorithms used to reduce instance sizes.
\item Section~\ref{sec:solving:approx} presents approximation algorithms for the \gls{pcstp}.
\item Section~\ref{sec:solving:heuristics} presents heuristics for finding good solutions to the \gls{pcstp}.
\item Section~\ref{sec:solving:lower} presents methods used for generating strong lower bounds for the \gls{pcstp}.
\item Section~\ref{sec:solving:exact} presents frameworks and combinations of the above used find exact solutions
   to the \gls{pcstp}.
\end{itemize}

\section{History}
\label{sec:solving:history}

Solutions to the \gls{pcstp} were first explored by \citet{Bienstock1993} who
proposed a 3-approximation algorithm based on the Christophides algorithm for the \gls{tsp}.
This was later improved to 2-approximation algorithm by
\citet{goemans1997primal} using a primal-dual method,
which was refined and implemented
for faster runtimes and typically better
bounds by \citet{Johnson:2000:PCS:338219.338637}.

\citet{canuto2001local} presented a primal heuristic based on multi-start
local search with perturbations and path relinking.

 In \citeyear{lucena2004strong}, \citet{lucena2004strong} stated an \gls{ilp} formulation of the \gls{pcstp} using \glspl{gsec},
along with a max-flow based separation used to generate strong lower bounds through cutting planes, and
\citet{Ljubic:2004:memetic}
 presented a memetic algorithm using tournament selection and mutation.

 \citet{ljubic2005solving} proposed the first algorithm for solving the \gls{pcstp} to provable optimality, along with an
 implementation commonly known as the DHEA-solver.
 This was done by solving
 equivalent \gls{sap} instances through branch-and-cut.
 Furthermore, they presented a set of real-world problem instances for the \gls{pcstp} based on network layout in Berlin.

 A common trait in the work done by
 \citet{lucena2004strong}, \citet{Ljubic:2004:memetic}, and \citet{ljubic2005solving}
 is the application of preprocessing routines
  ---known as reduction tests--- to their input graphs to reduce the size of instances.
  While they directly applied reduction tests
  defined for the \gls{stp} mainly by \citet{duin1989edge,duin1989reduction},
  these tests were were natively stated for the \gls{pcstp}
  by \citet{uchoa2006reduction} did so in \citeyear{uchoa2006reduction}.
  \citeauthor{uchoa2006reduction} both proved the validity
  for these reduction tests originally defined for the \gls{stp},
  but also introduced a new
  novel way of determining distances between nodes, resulting in
  even stronger reduction tests for the \gls{pcstp}.

  The 11th DIMACS Implementation Challenge\citep{DIMACS}, this time on Steiner tree problems,
  brought not only a new set of instances for the \gls{pcstp}, but
  also a new wave of contributions.

  Solving the \gls{pcstp} by transforming instances into equivalent problems in directed graphs
  was revisited by \citet{leitner2016dual} and \citet{gamrath2017scip}.
  \citet{leitner2016dual} transformed instances into the Asymmetric \gls{pcstp} (A\gls{pcstp})
  and employed a
  branch-and-bound framework generating lower bounds with a dual ascent method which was originally presented by \citet{wong1984dual} for the \gls{sap}, and
  generating incumbents with
  a shortest-path primal heuristics.
  \citet{gamrath2017scip} presented SCIP Jack -- an exact solver for \gls{stp} variants based on the solver (of the \gls{stp}, by way of \gls{sap}) presented by
  \citet{koch1998solving} and the \gls{mip} solver, SCIP \footnote{\url{http://scip.zib.de/}}\citep{GleixnerEtal2017OO}.
  Preprocessing routines were natively applied to \gls{pcstp} instances before transforming them into \gls{sap} instances.
  The \gls{sap} was formulated as an
  \gls{ilp} in a so-called \textit{Flow-Balanced Directed Cut Formulation}. The general branch-and-bound
  procedures of the SCIP optimization suite were
  then employed together with a constraint separation procedure defined by \citet{koch1998solving}.

  Developments were also made in field of heuristics for the \gls{pcstp}. \citet{fu2014knowledge} presented a tabu search and a neighbourhood definition
  using a new \textit{vertex swap} operation, while
  \citet{akhmedov2016divide} presented a clustering heuristics for dividing \gls{pcstp} into sub problems.
  Additionally, they presented
  applications for the \gls{pcstp} within biology.

\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a survey on methods used to solve the \acrlong{pcstp}. We have covered
preprocessing methods to reduce graph size, approximation algorithms which give provably
good solutions, heuristics which give good solutions at low computational costs, lower
bounding methods, and algorithms which give exact solutions all for the \gls{pcstp}.

We have seen that preprocessing routines are a strong component of
research on the \gls{pcstp} and are
used widely by authors whenever experimental results are presented. It seems that
any serious attempt at solving large instances of the \gls{pcstp} \textit{must} involve a
preprocessing routine containing some of the reduction tests presented above.

A reoccurring tendency has been that research on the \gls{pcstp} leans on
previous results for the \gls{stp}. This is both the case for preprocessing
where \citet{uchoa2006reduction} converts reduction tests from the \gls{stp}
to the \gls{pcstp}, and in the area of exact solvers where both solvers
initially transform their inputs into problem instances in directed graphs
guided by results on the \gls{stp} by \citet{chopra1994steiner}.

The two full solvers described in research, the DHEA and SCIP-Jack solvers, have show no
remarkable differences. Both similar preprocessing routines, directed versions of the problem,
similar \gls{ilp} models, the same separation routine, etc. This may indicated that research
in the area has reached some maturity.

% Notes from the exact section:
% Both use \gls{sap} transformations
% SCIP uses an actual \gls{sap} instead of the \gls{pcsap}ish favoured by Ljubic

% Both make use of multipurpose solvers
% Both use the max flow separation of the GSECs
% Both heavily inspired by \gls{stp} research
