\chapter{Solving the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem}
\label{chap:solving}

In this chapter, we will present a survey of methods used to solve the \gls{pcstp}. Due to the nature of solving
NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problems, this involves the the mixing and matching of methods within larger frameworks.
 After a rundown of the history of solving the \gls{pcstp} in section \ref{sec:solving:history}, we will present the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Section \ref{sec:solving:pre} presents preprocessing algorithms used to reduce instance sizes.
\item Section \ref{sec:solving:approx} presents approximations for solving the \gls{pcstp}.
\item Section \ref{sec:solving:heuristics} presents heuristics for solving the \gls{pcstp}.
\item Section \ref{sec:solving:lower} presents methods used for generating lower bounds.
\item Section \ref{sec:solving:exact} presents frameworks and combinations of the above used find exact solutions
   to the \gls{pcstp}.
\end{itemize}

\section{History}
\label{sec:solving:history}

Solutions to the \gls{pcstp} were first explored by \citet{Bienstock1993} who
proposed a 3-approximation algorithm based on Christophides algorithm for the TSP.
This was later improved to 2-approximation algorithm by
\citet{goemans1997primal} using a primal-dual method,
which was refined and implemented
for faster runtimes and typically better
bounds by \citet{Johnson:2000:PCS:338219.338637}.

\citet{canuto2001local} presented a primal heuristic based on multi-start
local search with pertubations and path relinking.

An \gls{ilp} formulation based on the \gls{gsec} formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem was
stated by \citet{lucena2004strong}, who presented an algorithm for solving the LP relaxation of the \gls{gsec} formulation using
a separation procedure as a method for generating a strong lower bound for the \gls{pcstp}. Similarly, \citet{Ljubic:2004:memetic}
presented a memetic algorithm using tournament selection and mutation. They additionally presented an \gls{ilp} formulation of the Steiner
 Aborescence Problem, based on cuts, the LP-relaxation of which was solved on a subgraph extracted from the memetic algorithm to
 improve the solutions as a postprocessing step.

 \citet{ljubic2005solving} proposed the first full framework for solving the \gls{pcstp} to optimality.
 This was done by solving
 equivalent \gls{sap} instances through branch-and-cut. Solving the LP-relaxation of a cut-formulation of the \gls{sap} with a
 a separation procedure was used to generate lower bounds.
  Furthermore, they presented a set of real-world problem instances for the \gls{pcstp} based on network layout in Berlin.

  \citet{lucena2004strong}, \citet{Ljubic:2004:memetic}, and \citet{ljubic2005solving} all applied preprocessing routines
  -- known as reduction tests -- to their input graphs to reduce the size of instances.
  These were originally gathered for
  the Steiner Tree Problem by \citet{duin1989edge,duin1989reduction},
  but no reduction tests had been stated and proven for the \gls{pcstp}
  until \citeauthor{uchoa2006reduction} did so in \citeyear{uchoa2006reduction}.
  \citeauthor{uchoa2006reduction} revisited
  reduction tests originally defined for the \gls{stp},
  but also introduced a new
  novel way of determining distances between nodes,
  allowing for stronger reduction tests.

  The 11th DIMACS challenge on Steiner tree problems\footnote{\url{http://dimacs11.zib.de/}}
  brought not only a new set of instances for the \gls{pcstp}, but
  also a new wave of contributions.

  Solving the \gls{pcstp} by transforming instances into equivalent problems in directed graphs
  was revisited by \citet{leitner2016dual} and \citet{gamrath2017scip}.
  \citet{leitner2016dual} transformed instances into the Asymmetric \gls{pcstp} (A\gls{pcstp})
  and employed a
  branch-and-bound framework generating lower bounds with a dual ascent method which was originally presented by \citet{wong1984dual} for the \gls{sap}, and
  generating incumbents with
  a shortest-path primal heuristics.
  \citet{gamrath2017scip} presented SCIP Jack -- an exact solver for \gls{stp} variants based on the solver (of the \gls{stp}, by way of \gls{sap}) presented by
  \citet{koch1998solving} and the \gls{mip} solver, SCIP \footnote{\url{http://scip.zib.de/}}.
  Preprocessing routines were natively applied to \gls{pcstp} instances before transforming them into \gls{sap} instances.
  The \gls{sap} was formulated as an
  \gls{ilp} in a so-called \textit{Flow-Balanced Directed Cut Formulation}. The general branch-and-bound
  procedures of the SCIP optimization suite were
  then employed together with a contraint separation procedure defined in \citet{koch1998solving}.

  Developments were also made in field of heuristics for the \gls{pcstp}. \citet{fu2014knowledge} presented a tabu search and a neighbourhood definition
  using a new \textit{vertex swap} operation.
  \citet{akhmedov2016divide} presented a clustering heuristics for dividing \gls{pcstp} into subproblems,
  and additionally a
  reimplementation of the solver by \citet{ljubic2005solving} which was used to solve problems defined by the subgraphs. Additionally, they presented
  applications for the \gls{pcstp} within biology.
  \citet{biazzo2012performance} explored the performance of the cavity method on the \gls{pcstp}.

\section{Conclusion}


\textit{Preprocessing is strong}
\textit{Very similar to the research on the STP}
\textit{GW Algorithm is an important milestone}
\textit{Not a lot of variety in solvers / agreement in methods}
% Notes from the exact section:
% Both use \gls{sap} transformations
% SCIP uses an actual \gls{sap} instead of the \gls{pcsap}ish favoured by Ljubic

% Both make use of multipurpose solvers
% Both use the max flow separation of the GSECs
% Both heavily inspired by \gls{stp} research
