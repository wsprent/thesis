\section{Preprocessing}
Applying preprocessing routines to heavily reduce input graphs is a common technique which has been proven succesful in many cases both for instances of the STP
\citep{koch1998solving}
and instances of the PCSTP
\citep{ljubic2005solving, gamrath2017scip}. %TODO: MORE
These routines make use of proven invariants to remove and contract edges as well as choose edges before applying the any main procedure.
A set of common preprocessing routines are applied in different manners in literature, mainly differentiated by:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item which routines to apply,
\item in which order, and
\item when to recursively apply routines and how many times.
\end{enumerate}
Preprocessing routines can be very effective. For example, the preprocesing routine presented by \cite{koch1998solving} for the STP removes
up to 98\% of edges in some instances. In this section, we will first give a full overview of existing preprocessing methods for the PCSTP,
 including proofs of validity,
 and then summarize their usage in recent literature.

 In the following, we will denote any edge or vertex (or part of a graph) as \textit{redundant} if there exists an optimal solution
  which does not contain it, and we say that a 
  transformation to a problem instance is \textit{valid} when produces an equivalent problem, that is a problem which has the same optimal
  value and in which solutions map back to the original problem.

 \subsection{Local Reduction Tests}
 The first type of reductions we will look at, we will named \textit{local} reduction tests. These are tests which only require knowledge
 of the neighbourhood of a couple of vertexes in the graph, and perhaps simple global information such as maximum prize. As such, the tests
 presented in this section are generally of low computational cost, allowing for testing a full graph in linear time.

 Note that the first tests presented (NTD1, NTD2, TD1, TD2) are known collectively
 in recent literature as \textit{Degree Tests}, for example in \cite{rehfeldt2016reduction}.
\subsubsection{Non-Terminals of Degree 1}
\label{sec:red:test:deg1}
Let $G = (V, E, c, p)$ be a PCST instance and let $v \in V$ be any non-terminal with degree 1, then
 clearly -- since edges have positive weights -- $v$ can not be part of an optimal solution. Thus $v$ is redundant. In other words,
 all vertices in the set
 $$\{v \mid v \in V \setminus N \wedge |\delta(v)| = 1\}$$
 are redundant and it is valid to remove them from $G$ along with their adjacent edges.

 While this reduction test is originally stated for the STP \citep{hwang1992steiner}, it is also applicable to the PCSTP. Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:deg1})
  shows an example of removing a degree 1 non-terminal.

  \subsubsection{Non-Terminals of Degree 2}
    \label{fig:red:test2}
\todo{These two sections probably use too different methods in defining their reductions}
    Similarly, let $G = (V,E,c,p)$ be an instance of the PCSTP, let $v \in G$ be a non-terminal with degree $|\delta(v)| = 2$, and let
    $u$ and $w$ be the two vertices adjacent to $v$. Then we can obtain a reduced, equivalent graph,
    $$G' = (V', E', c', p)$$
    where
    $$V' = V - v \mathnormal{,}$$
    $$E' = (E \setminus \{(u,v),(w,v)\}) \cup \{(u,w)\}\mathnormal{,}$$
    and
    $$c_{uw} =
    \begin{cases}
      \min(c_{uw}, c_{uv} + c_{vw}) & (u,w) \in E\mathnormal{,} \\
      c_{uv} + c_{vw} & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}$$

    In other words, if $c_{uv} + c_{vw} <  c_{uw}$ then $(u,w)$ is redundant, can be removed, and $v$ and its edges
    can be contracted to a single edge.
    Otherwise $v$ and its edges are redundant and can be removed. Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:deg2})
    shows an example this reduction test.

\subsubsection{Minimum Adjacency}
Again defined in \cite{duin1989reduction} for the STP, the \textit{minimum adjacency test}
(also known as the \textit{$V \setminus K$ test}) is a reduction test which contracts adjacent
terminals as shown in Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:ma}).

\begin{theorem}[Minimum Adjacency]
  Let $u$ and $v$ be adjacent terminals in $G$. If we have
  $$\min(p_u, p_v) \geq c_{uv}$$
  and
  $$c_{uv} = \min_{(u, w) \in E}c_{uw}$$
  then it is valid to contract $u$ and $v$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  It can be shown that any solution $T$ for the PCSTP problem defined by a graph $G$
  which contains $u$ but not $(u,v)$ can
  be transformed into a solution $T'$ which contains $(u,v)$ where $c(T') \leq c(T)$.

  \paragraph{Case 1: $v \in V_T$}
  Let $(u, w) \in E_T$ be the first edge in the simple path from $u$ to $v$. By assumption, we
  have that $c_{uv} \leq c_{uw}$, and the tree $T'$ constructed by removing $(u,w)$ from $T$ and
  adding $(u,v)$ has cost
  $$c(T') = c(T) - c_{uw} + c_{uv} \leq T\mathnormal{.}$$
  \paragraph{Case 2: $v  \not\in V_T$}
  Let $T'$ be the tree obtained by adding $(u,v)$ to $T$. As per the assumption that $\min(p_u, p_v) \geq c_{uv}$,
  we have that $T'$ has cost,
  $$c(T') = c(T) + c_{uv} - p_{uv} \leq c(T)\mathnormal{.}$$
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Unconnected Dominated Vertex}


\subsection{Steiner Distance Reduction Tests}
% $$d(u,v) = \min \{ c(P) \mid P \in \mathcal{P}_{uv}\}$$
More complex tests can be described in terms
of the concepts Steiner distance and Bottleneck distance. These were originally stated for
the STP in, amongst others, \cite{duin1989edge,duin1989reduction} and later
adapted for the PCSTP in \cite{uchoa2006reduction}.

First we must make some definitions.
If $P = (..., u, ..., w, ...)$ is a simple path in $G$, then $P_{uw}$ is
the subpath in $P$ starting at vertex $u$ and ending in vertex $w$,
\todo{Some of this should probably go in a notations section}
that is $P_{u,w} = (u, ...,w)$. Then we define the \textit{Steiner distance} of
 $P_{uw}$ as,

 $$sd(P_{uw}) = \sum_{(i,j) \in E(P_{u,w})} c_{i,j} -
 \sum_{v \in V(P) \setminus \{u,w\}} p_{v}\mathnormal{.}$$
 We then denote the Steiner distance of a simple path, $P$, as the maximal Steiner
 distance found among subpaths of $P$,
 $$sd(P) = \max_{u,w \in P} sd(P_{uw})\mathnormal{.}$$
 Let $\mathcal{P}_{uw}$ be the set of all simple paths
 connecting vertices $u$ and $w$ in
 $G$, then we denote the \textit{bottleneck distance} between $u$ and $w$ as minimal Steiner
  distance among paths in $\mathcal{P}_{uw}$,
  $$B(u,w) = \min_{P \in  \mathcal{P}_{uw}} sd(P)\mathnormal{.}$$
  The bottleneck distance is a measure of the worst case \textit{additional cost}
  \todo{Make decision on whether I should replicated proofs for claims like this.}
 of connecting
 two disjoint subgraphs containing vertices $u$ and $v$ respectively in $G$.

  \missingfigure{Some visual intuition on the bottleneck distance}

  Finally, we denote the bottleneck distance between vertices $u$ and $w$ \textit{excluding}
  the edge $e$ as,
  $$B(u,w)^{-e} = \min_{P \in  \mathcal{P}_{uw}, e \not \in P} sd(P)\mathnormal{.}$$


 \cite{uchoa2006reduction} shows that calculating the bottleneck distance
 is an NP hard problem by reduction from the Hamiltonian Path problem. Hence,
 exactly calculating the bottleneck distance is infeasible. However, \cite{uchoa2006reduction}
 also claims that existing heuristics are fast and give strong upper bounds.
 \subsubsection{Special Distance}
 \label{sec:red:test:sd}
 Using the PCSTP version of the Steiner and bottleneck distances, \cite{uchoa2006reduction} proves
  the validity of the more general \textit{special distance test}.
 \begin{theorem}[Special Distance Test]
 Consider any edge $(u,v) \in E$. If we have
 $$B(u,v)^{-(u,v)} \leq c_{uv}$$
 then $(u,v)$ is redundant.
\end{theorem}
 \begin{proof}
   Let $T  \subseteq G$ be an optimal solution to the PCSTP in graph $G$
   where we have
   $$B(u,v)^{-(u,v)} \leq c_{uv}$$
   for some edge $(u,v) \in E_T$, and let $(T_1, T_2)$ be the cut bridged
   by $(u,v)$.

   Consider then the simple path $P \in \mathcal{P}_{uv}$ from $u$ to $v$ which doesn't
    contain $(u,v)$ and has
   $$sd(P) = B(u,v)^{-(u,v)}\mathnormal{.}$$

   Since $T$ is a tree, and $P$ by definition doesn't contain the edge $(u,v)$
   then we must have that $P$ consists of a subpath contained in $T_1$, followed by
   a subpath not contained in $T$, followed by a subpath contained in $T_2$.
   In other words, we have,
   $$P = (u, P_1, w, P_2, z, P_3, v)$$
   as shown in Figure \ref{fig:red:test:sd:thm}.

   Then by definition we have,
   $$sd(P_2) \leq sd(P) = B(u,v)^{-(u,v)} \leq c_{uv}$$
   and we construct another solution $T'$ by replacing $(u,v)$ with the
   vertices and edges in $P_2$ which has cost
   $$c(T') = c(T) - c_{uv} + sd(P_2) \leq c(T)\mathnormal{.}$$
   Hence $T'$ also optimal in $G$ and $(u,v)$ is by definition redundant.

\subsubsection{Non-Terminals of Degree 3}
\label{sec:red:test:deg3}
Another bottleneck distance based test,
also proved valid for the PCSTP in \cite{uchoa2006reduction},
is the \textit{non-terminals of degree 3 test}.
\begin{theorem}[Non-Terminals of Degree 3 Test]\label{thm:ntd3}
  Let $u$ be a vertex with degree 3 in $G = (V, E, c, p)$,
  and let $v$, $w$, and $z$ be its adjacent
  vertices. If we have
  $$\min\left(B(v,w) + B(v,z), B(w,v) + B(w,z),  B(z, v)+ B(z, w)\right) \leq
  c_{uv} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}$$
  then there exists an optimal solution to $G$ where $u$ has degree of
  \textit{at most} 2, that is $|\delta(u)| \leq 2$. Thus $u$ and its three edges, can be replaced by
  the edges $\{(v, w), (w,z), (z,v)\}$ with costs
  $$c_{vw} = c_{vu} + c_{uw},\quad c_{wz} = c_{wu} + c_{uz},\quad c_{zv} = c_{zu} + c_{uv}\mathnormal{.}$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}   
  W.l.o.g. consider the case where $B(v,w) + B(v,z) \leq c_{uv} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}$,
  and let $T$ be an optimal solution which contains $(u,v)$, $(u,w)$, and $(u,z)$.

  Let $P_1 = (v, ..., w)$ be the simple path with Steiner distance
  $$sd(P_1) = B(v,w)$$
  and similarly let $P_2 = (v, ..., z)$ be the simple path with Steiner distance
  $$sd(P_2) = B(v,z)\mathnormal{.}$$
  This gives us the situation in Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:ntd3:thm}). Note that $u$ may be a part of either paths.

  Let $T_v$, $T_w$, and $T_z$ be the subtrees of $T$ obtained by
  removing the edges adjacent to $u$ from $T$, and construct a new solution with
   total cost no-larger than $T$ as,
   $$T' = T_v \cup T_w \cup T_z \cup P_1 \cup P_2\mathnormal{.}$$
   We must have $|\delta_{T'}(u)| \leq 2$. If we had $|\delta_{T'}| = 3$ then
   we would have
   $$P_1 = \left[v, (v,u), u, (u,w), w \right]$$
   and
   $$P_2 = \left[v, (v,u), u, (u,z) z \right]$$
   giving us
   $$B(v,w) + B(v, z) = sd(P_1) + sd(P_2) = 2 c_{vu} + c_{uw} + c_{uz} > c_{vu} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}$$
   which is a contradiction to our original assumption that
   $$B(v,w) + B(v,z) \leq c_{uv} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}\mathnormal{.}$$
   Thus $T'$ is an optimal solution to $G$ with $|\delta_{T'}(u)| \leq 2$.
\end{proof}
