 \section{Preprocessing}
 \label{sec:solving:pre}
Applying preprocessing routines to heavily reduce input graphs is a common technique which has been proven succesful in many cases both for instances of the \gls{stp}
\citep{koch1998solving}
and instances of the \gls{pcstp}
\citep{lucena2004strong,canuto2001local,ljubic2005solving, gamrath2017scip}. %TODO: MORE
These routines make use of proven invariants to remove and contract edges as well as choose edges before applying the any main procedure.
A set of common preprocessing routines are applied in different manners in literature, mainly differentiated by:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item which routines to apply,
\item in which order, and
\item when to recursively apply routines and how many times.
\end{enumerate}
Preprocessing routines can be very effective. For example, the preprocesing routine presented by \cite{koch1998solving} for the \gls{stp} removes
up to 98\% of edges in some instances. In this section, we will first give a full overview of existing preprocessing methods for the \gls{pcstp},
 including proofs of validity,
 and then summarize their usage in recent literature.

 In the following, we will denote any edge or vertex (or part of a graph) as \textit{redundant} if there exists an optimal solution
  which does not contain it, and we say that a 
  transformation to a problem instance is \textit{valid} when produces an equivalent problem, that is a problem which has the same optimal
  value and in which solutions map back to the original problem.

 \subsection{Local Reduction Tests}\label{sec:pre:local}
 The first type of reductions we will look at, we will named \textit{local} reduction tests. These are tests which only require knowledge
 of the neighbourhood of a couple of vertexes in the graph, and potentially static global information
 such as maximum prize. As such, the tests
 presented in this section are generally of low computational cost, allowing for testing a full graph in linear time.

 Note that the first tests presented (NTD1, NTD2, TD1, TD2) are known collectively
 in recent literature as \textit{Degree Tests}, for example in \cite{rehfeldt2016reduction}.
\subsubsection{Non-Terminals of Degree 1 (NTD1)}
\label{sec:red:test:deg1}
Let $G = (V, E, c, p)$ be a PCST instance and let $v \in V$ be any non-terminal with degree 1, then
 clearly -- since edges have positive weights -- $v$ can not be part of an optimal solution. Thus $v$ is redundant. In other words,
 all vertices in the set
 $$\{v \mid v \in V \setminus N \wedge |\delta(v)| = 1\}$$
 are redundant and it is valid to remove them from $G$ along with their adjacent edges.

  \caption{Removing a non-terminal with degree 1.}
  \label{fig:red:test:deg1}
\end{figure}

 While this reduction test is originally stated for the \gls{stp} \citep{hwang1992steiner}, it is also applicable to the \gls{pcstp}. Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:deg1})
  shows an example of removing a degree 1 non-terminal.

  \subsubsection{Non-Terminals of Degree 2 (NTD2)}
    \label{fig:red:test2}
\todo{These two sections probably use too different methods in defining their reductions}
    Similarly, let $G = (V,E,c,p)$ be an instance of the \gls{pcstp}, let $v \in G$ be a non-terminal with degree $|\delta(v)| = 2$, and let
    $u$ and $w$ be the two vertices adjacent to $v$. Then we can obtain a reduced, equivalent graph,
    $$G' = (V', E', c', p)$$
    where
    $$V' = V - v \mathnormal{,}$$
    $$E' = (E \setminus \{(u,v),(w,v)\}) \cup \{(u,w)\}\mathnormal{,}$$
    and
    $$c_{uw} =
    \begin{cases}
      \min(c_{uw}, c_{uv} + c_{vw}) & (u,w) \in E\mathnormal{,} \\
      c_{uv} + c_{vw} & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}$$

    In other words, if $c_{uv} + c_{vw} <  c_{uw}$ then $(u,w)$ is redundant, can be removed, and $v$ and its edges
    can be contracted to a single edge.
    Otherwise $v$ and its edges are redundant and can be removed. Figure (\ref{fig:pre:ntd2})
    shows an example this reduction test.

  \label{fig:pre:ntd2}
\end{figure}

This test is another example of a reduction test for the \gls{stp} which can by directly applied to
 the \gls{pcstp}.
 \subsubsection{Terminals of Degree 1 (TD1)}\label{sec:pre:td1}
 When we have a terminal, $u$, of degree one, we can make the following two observations:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item If the cost of the edge adjacent to $u$ is higher than $p_u$, then that edge is redundant, and
 \item additionally, if there exists a vertex with at least as high prize as $u$, then $u$ is redundant.
 \end{enumerate}
 These observations were stated first in \cite{uchoa2006reduction} -- however without the second condition,
 making the redundancy of $u$ potentially invalid -- and later corrected in \cite{rehfeldt2016reduction} as a combined test.

 We state here only the first part here as the TD1 test to allow for the disconnection of vertices with maximal prize.
 \begin{theorem}[Terminals of Degree 1 Test]
   Let $u$ be a terminal in $G$ with degree of 1 with adjacent edge $(u, v)$. If
   $p_u < c_{uv}$ then $(u,v)$ is redundant.
 \end{theorem}

 Applying this definition of TD1 in conjection with the UDV test (defined in Section \ref{sec:pre:udv})
 allows for the potential removal of terminals of degree one (see Figure \ref{fig:red:test:deg1}), giving the
  test defined in \cite{uchoa2006reduction} and \cite{rehfeldt2016reduction}.

\subsubsection{Terminals of Degree 2 (TD2)} 
Similarly to TD1, we can disconnect terminals with degree 2 where both edges have costs higher than the prize
 of the terminal. Formally we state this as,
 \begin{theorem}[Terminals of Degree 2 Test]
   Let $u$ be a vertex with degree 2, such that vertices $v$ and $w$ are adjacent to $u$. Suppose that
   $$p_u \leq \min(c_{uv}, c_{uw})$$
   then any optimal solution must \textit{either} contain both edges or neither.
   Thus it is valid to replace the edges $(u,v)$ and $(u,w)$ with a single edge $(w,v)$ with cost
   $$c_{wv} = c_{uv} + c_{uw} - p_u\mathnormal{.}$$
 \end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Unconnected Dominated Vertex (UDV)}\label{sec:pre:udv}
Proposed in \cite{rehfeldt2016reduction}, the \textit{unconnected dominated vertex test} reduces the
graph by removing any subgraph which contains at most one terminal which has less than maximum prize.
Stated formally as in the following theorem, which we will not prove.
\begin{theorem}[Unconnected Dominated Vertex Test]
  Consider a connected subgraph $S = (V_S, E_S, c, p)$ of $G$. Let $N_S = \{v \in V_s \mid p_v > 0\}$
  be the set of terminals in $S$. Then $S$ is redundant and removing it is valid if either
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $N = \emptyset$, or
  \item $N = \{u\}$ and $p_u \leq \max_{v \in V \setminus \{u\}} p_v$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


This test can easily be applied as a special case for subgraphs consisting of a single,
 unconnected vertex.
 Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:deg1}) shows the application
 of TD1 followed directly by UDV.

\subsubsection{Minimum Adjacency (MA)}
Again defined in \cite{duin1989reduction} for the \gls{stp} but also applicable for the \gls{pcstp},
the \textit{minimum adjacency test}
(also known as the \textit{$V \setminus K$ test}) 
is a reduction test which contracts any adjacent
terminals which are connected by an edge with lower cost than either of their prizes.
 This is shown in Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:ma}).

\begin{theorem}[Minimum Adjacency]
  Let $u$ and $v$ be adjacent terminals in $G$. If we have
  $$c_{uv} \leq \min(p_u, p_v)$$
  and
  $$c_{uv} = \min_{(u, w) \in E}c_{uw}$$
  then it is valid to contract $u$ and $v$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  It can be shown that any solution $T$ for the \gls{pcstp} problem defined by a graph $G$
  which contains $u$ but not $(u,v)$ can
  be transformed into a solution $T'$ which contains $(u,v)$ where $c(T') \leq c(T)$.

  \paragraph{Case 1: ($v \in V_T$)}
  Let $(u, w) \in E_T$ be the first edge in the simple path from $u$ to $v$. By assumption, we
  have that $c_{uv} \leq c_{uw}$, and the tree $T'$ constructed by removing $(u,w)$ from $T$ and
  adding $(u,v)$ has cost
  $$c(T') = c(T) - c_{uw} + c_{uv} \leq T\mathnormal{.}$$
  \paragraph{Case 2: ($v  \not\in V_T$)}
  Let $T'$ be the tree obtained by adding $(u,v)$ to $T$. As per the assumption that $\min(p_u, p_v) \geq c_{uv}$,
  we have that $T'$ has cost,
  $$c(T') = c(T) + c_{uv} - p_{uv} \leq c(T)\mathnormal{.}$$
\end{proof}


\subsection{Steiner Distance Reduction Tests}\label{sec:sd-red-test}
% $$d(u,v) = \min \{ c(P) \mid P \in \mathcal{P}_{uv}\}$$
More complex tests can be described in terms
of the concepts Steiner distance and Bottleneck distance. These were originally stated for
the \gls{stp} in, amongst others, \cite{duin1989edge,duin1989reduction} and later
adapted for the \gls{pcstp} in \cite{uchoa2006reduction}.

First we must make some definitions.
If $P = (..., u, ..., w, ...)$ is a simple path in $G$, then $P_{uw}$ is
the subpath in $P$ starting at vertex $u$ and ending in vertex $w$,
\todo{Some of this should probably go in a notations section}
that is $P_{u,w} = (u, ...,w)$. Then we define the \textit{Steiner distance} of
 $P_{uw}$ as,

 $$sd(P_{uw}) = \sum_{(i,j) \in E(P_{u,w})} c_{i,j} -
 \sum_{v \in V(P) \setminus \{u,w\}} p_{v}\mathnormal{.}$$
 We then denote the Steiner distance of a simple path, $P$, as the maximal Steiner
 distance found among subpaths of $P$,
 $$sd(P) = \max_{u,w \in P} sd(P_{uw})\mathnormal{.}$$
 Let $\mathcal{P}_{uw}$ be the set of all simple paths
 connecting vertices $u$ and $w$ in
 $G$, then we denote the \textit{bottleneck distance} between $u$ and $w$ as the minimal Steiner
  distance among paths in $\mathcal{P}_{uw}$,
  $$B(u,w) = \min_{P \in  \mathcal{P}_{uw}} sd(P)\mathnormal{.}$$
  The bottleneck distance is a measure of the worst case \textit{additional cost}
  \todo{Proof? Maybe.}
 of connecting
 two disjoint subgraphs containing vertices $u$ and $v$ respectively in $G$.

  \missingfigure{Some visual intuition on the bottleneck distance}

  Finally, we denote the bottleneck distance between vertices $u$ and $w$ \textit{excluding}
  the edge $e$ as,
  $$B(u,w)^{-e} = \min_{P \in  \mathcal{P}_{uw}, e \not \in P} sd(P)\mathnormal{.}$$


 \cite{uchoa2006reduction} shows that calculating the bottleneck distance
 is an NP hard problem by reduction from the Hamiltonian Path problem. Hence,
 exactly calculating the bottleneck distance is infeasible. However, \cite{uchoa2006reduction}
 also claims that existing heuristics are fast and give strong upper bounds.

It is worth noting that due to
\begin{enumerate*}[label={\alph*)}]
\item the relatively new proposal of the Steiner/bottleneck distances in \cite{uchoa2006reduction} for the \gls{pcstp}, and
\item their computational complexities,
\end{enumerate*}
the reduction tests stated in this section have been applied in literature
using ordinary distance (i.e. ignoring prizes) and shortests paths
instead of the Steiner and bottleneck distances. This corresponds to the direct application of
reduction tests
proposed for the \gls{stp} in \cite{duin1989edge,duin1989reduction}. Since this results in
upper bounds on the bottleneck distance, the original
tests are still valid for the \gls{pcstp},
but are weaker than the natively tests proposed in \cite{uchoa2006reduction}.

When we talk
 about \textit{shortest path relaxations} of the following tests, this is what we are referring to.

 \subsubsection{Special Distance (SD)}
 \label{sec:red:test:sd}
 Using the \gls{pcstp} version of the Steiner and bottleneck distances, \cite{uchoa2006reduction} proves
  the validity of the more general \textit{special distance test}.
 \begin{theorem}[Special Distance Test]
 Consider any edge $(u,v) \in E$. If we have
 $$B(u,v)^{-(u,v)} \leq c_{uv}$$
 then $(u,v)$ is redundant.
\end{theorem}
 \begin{proof}
   Let $T  \subseteq G$ be an optimal solution to the \gls{pcstp} in graph $G$
   where we have
   $$B(u,v)^{-(u,v)} \leq c_{uv}$$
   for some edge $(u,v) \in E_T$, and let $(T_1, T_2)$ be the cut bridged
   by $(u,v)$.

   Consider then the simple path $P \in \mathcal{P}_{uv}$ from $u$ to $v$ which doesn't
    contain $(u,v)$ and has
   $$sd(P) = B(u,v)^{-(u,v)}\mathnormal{.}$$

   Since $T$ is a tree, and $P$ by definition doesn't contain the edge $(u,v)$
   then we must have that $P$ consists of a subpath contained in $T_1$, followed by
   a subpath not contained in $T$, followed by a subpath contained in $T_2$.
   In other words, we have,
   $$P = (u, P_1, w, P_2, z, P_3, v)$$
   as shown in Figure \ref{fig:red:test:sd:thm}.

   Then by definition we have,
   $$sd(P_2) \leq sd(P) = B(u,v)^{-(u,v)} \leq c_{uv}$$
   and we construct another solution $T'$ by replacing $(u,v)$ with the
   vertices and edges in $P_2$ which has cost
   $$c(T') = c(T) - c_{uv} + sd(P_2) \leq c(T)\mathnormal{.}$$
   Hence $T'$ also optimal in $G$ and $(u,v)$ is by definition redundant.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Non-Terminals of Degree 3 (NTD3)}
\label{sec:red:test:deg3}
Another bottleneck distance based test,
also proved valid for the \gls{pcstp} in \cite{uchoa2006reduction},
is the \textit{non-terminals of degree 3 test}.
\begin{theorem}[Non-Terminals of Degree 3 Test]\label{thm:ntd3}
  Let $u$ be a vertex with degree 3 in $G = (V, E, c, p)$,
  and let $v$, $w$, and $z$ be its adjacent
  vertices. If we have
  $$\min\left(B(v,w) + B(v,z), B(w,v) + B(w,z),  B(z, v)+ B(z, w)\right) \leq
  c_{uv} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}$$
  then there exists an optimal solution to $G$ where $u$ has degree of
  \textit{at most} 2, that is $|\delta(u)| \leq 2$. Thus $u$ and its three edges, can be replaced by
  the edges $\{(v, w), (w,z), (z,v)\}$ with costs
  $$c_{vw} = c_{vu} + c_{uw},\quad c_{wz} = c_{wu} + c_{uz},\quad c_{zv} = c_{zu} + c_{uv}\mathnormal{.}$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}   
  W.l.o.g. consider the case where $B(v,w) + B(v,z) \leq c_{uv} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}$,
  and let $T$ be an optimal solution which contains $(u,v)$, $(u,w)$, and $(u,z)$.

  Let $P_1 = (v, ..., w)$ be the simple path with Steiner distance
  $$sd(P_1) = B(v,w)$$
  and similarly let $P_2 = (v, ..., z)$ be the simple path with Steiner distance
  $$sd(P_2) = B(v,z)\mathnormal{.}$$
  This gives us the situation in Figure (\ref{fig:red:test:ntd3:thm}). Note that $u$ may be a part of either paths.

  Let $T_v$, $T_w$, and $T_z$ be the subtrees of $T$ obtained by
  removing the edges adjacent to $u$ from $T$, and construct a new solution with
   total cost no-larger than $T$ as,
   $$T' = T_v \cup T_w \cup T_z \cup P_1 \cup P_2\mathnormal{.}$$
   We must have $|\delta_{T'}(u)| \leq 2$. If we had $|\delta_{T'}| = 3$ then
   we would have
   $$P_1 = \left[v, (v,u), u, (u,w), w \right]$$
   and
   $$P_2 = \left[v, (v,u), u, (u,z) z \right]$$
   giving us
   $$B(v,w) + B(v, z) = sd(P_1) + sd(P_2) = 2 c_{vu} + c_{uw} + c_{uz} > c_{vu} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}$$
   which is a contradiction to our original assumption that
   $$B(v,w) + B(v,z) \leq c_{uv} + c_{uw} + c_{uz}\mathnormal{.}$$
   Thus $T'$ is an optimal solution to $G$ with $|\delta_{T'}(u)| \leq 2$.

\subsubsection{Non-Terminals of Degree k (NTDk)}
\todo[inline]{This is stated somewhat in the Uchoa paper and weirdly in the Rehfeldt paper. The latter claims that the former proves it, but there is no such proof. Shouldn't be too difficult}

\subsection{Voronoi Reductions}

Reduction test based on a Voronoi decomposition of the input graph was introduced for the \gls{pcstp} by \cite{rehfeldt2016reduction}. These reduction tests broadly
involve using the Voronoi decomposition to generate conditional lower bounds based on vertex inclusion/exclusion. Given a strong upper bound, these can be used
to reduce the graph.

\paragraph{Voronoi Decomposition of a \gls{pcstp} Graph}

Given an instance of the \gls{pcstp} with the undirected graph $G = (V, E, c, p)$ and terminal set
$N \subseteq V$, we define a Voronoi region for a given terminal, $i \in N$, as the set of nonterminals
which are closer to $i$ than any other terminal in terms of simple shortests paths -- that is,
$$R_i = \left\{v \in V \setminus N \mid i = \argmin_{u \in N} d_{vu}\right\}$$
where $R_i$ is the Voronoi region covered by the terminal $i$ and $d_{vu}$ is the shortest path between vertices
$v$ and $u$.

We then define the \textit{radius} of the $i$th Voronoi region as the shortest path from its centre (the $i$ith terminal)
to any vertex not in the region,
$$\radius(i) = \min_{v \not\in R_i} d_{iv}\mathnormal{.}$$
From this we define a \textit{prize-collecting radius} of a region as,
$$\pcradius(i) = \min(\radius(i), p_i)\mathnormal{.}$$
We note that we can intuitively see the \textit{pc radius} of a region as a kind of lower bound
on the cost contribution
 of that region to any
 \textit{connected}, multi-vertex solution. Either the prize for the respective terminal must be paid as a penalty
 \textit{or} the terminal must be connected to the rest of the tree by a path which must have some cost \textit{higher}
 than the \textit{radius} of the region.

 Finally, let
 $$z_1, z_2, ..., z_{|N|}$$
 be a monotonically increasing ordering of terminals such that
$$\pcradius(z_1) \leq \pcradius(z_2) \leq ... \leq \pcradius(z_{|N|})\mathnormal{.}$$

\paragraph{Lower Bound Reductions}

The first reduction we can present based on Voronoi regions is based on a lower bound given that some nonterminal is
part of a solution. This was first introduced for the \gls{stp} by \citet{polzin2001improved} and later adapted by
\citet{rehfeldt2016reduction} for the \gls{pcstp}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:vor:1}
  Let $T = (V_T, E_T, c, p)$ be a solution to the \gls{pcstp} in the graph $G = (V, E, c, p)$ with terminal set $N$ such that
  $v_k \in V_T$ for some $v_k \in V \setminus N$. Finally, let $v_a \in N$ and $v_b \in N$ be the two terminals \textit{closest}
  to $v_k$, then we have
  $$d(v_a, v_k) + d(v_b, v_k) + \sum_{i = 1}^{|N| - 2} \pcradius(z_i) \leq c(T)\mathnormal{.}$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a solution $T$ as described above containing some nonterminal $u \in V_T$.
  For all $j \in (N \cap V_T)$ let $P_i$ be the
  path from $v_i$ to $u$ in $T$ (this must be well defined as $T$ is a tree). Furthermore,
  let $P_i'$ be the subpath of $P_i$ which starts in $v_i$ and ends in the first vertex along
  $P_i$ not in $R_i$, and
  let $\Delta(P_i)$ be the number of times a Voronoi border is crossed by the path $P_i$ and
  let $\Delta(P_i) = \infty$ if $v_i \not\in V_T$.

  Let $v_m$ and $v_l$ be two terminals such that $\Delta(P_m) + \Delta(P_l)$ is minimal among
  all pairs of terminals where $P_m$ and $P_l$ are disjoint paths. Since $T$ is a tree and
  $v_i$ must have degree of at least $2$ (See Section \ref{sec:red:test:deg1}) there must
  be at least one such pair.

  Consider the set of paths
  $$\mathcal{P} = \{P_i' \mid i \in (V_T \cap N) \setminus \{v_m, v_l\} \}
  \mathnormal{.}$$
  These paths must be disjoint as $T$ contains no cycles. The paths in $\mathcal{P}$
  alongside $P_m$ and $P_l$ are then all pairwise disjoint paths which cover a subset of the
  edges
  in $E_T$.

  \caption{Example solution of the \gls{pcstp} split into paths.}
  \label{fig:pre:vor:pro}
\end{figure}
  

An example of this partition of $T$ is shown in Figure (\ref{fig:pre:vor:pro}). The two ``closest''
terminals $v_l$ and $v_m$ have disjoint paths $P_l$ and $P_m$ to the interesting nonterminal $v_i$.
The rest of the solution is partitioned by $P_i'$ paths, these paths run from a terminal towards $v_i$
until -- and inclusive -- the first edge which crosses a Voronoi boundary. No two paths in such a decomposition
can share an edge. This follows directly from the facts that each Voronoi region contains
\textit{only} a single terminal, and that there can be only a single path from vertex to $v_i$ (no cycles).
Hence a border edge can only be crossed in one ``direction'' this way.

With this, clearly the total edge costs of these paths cannot be greater than the edge cost of $T$. We select only
 in this way a subset of the edges of $T$, and never select an edge twice. In other words, we have
  \begin{equation}
    c(E(P_m)) + c(E(P_l)) + \sum_{P_i \in \mathcal{P}} c(E(P)) \leq c(E_T)\mathnormal{.}\label{eq:vor:one}
  \end{equation}

  
  Additionally, by definition
  we must have that $P_i' \leq \pcradius(i)$, $d(v_m, v_i) \leq c(E(P_m))$, and
  $d(v_l, v_i) \leq c(E(P_l))$. This gives us

  \begin{equation}
d(v_l, v_i) + d(v_m, v_i) + \sum_{P_i \in \mathcal{P}} \pcradius(i) \leq c(E(P_m)) + c(E(P_l)) + \sum_{P_i \in \mathcal{P}} c(E(P))\label{eq:vor:two}
\end{equation}


  Finally, for the set of terminals not covered by $T$, we must -- again by the definition of $\pcradius$ -- have
  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{i \in N \setminus V_T} \pcradius(i) \leq \sum_{i \in N \setminus V_T} p_i \mathnormal{.}\label{eq:vor:three}
  \end{equation}

  By combining the equations (\ref{eq:vor:one}), (\ref{eq:vor:two}), and (\ref{eq:vor:three}), and
   by the definition of vertices $v_a$ and $v_b$ being the terminals closest to $v_i$ we have,
   $$d(v_a, v_k) + d(v_b, v_k) + \sum_{i = 1}^{|N| - 2} \pcradius(z_i) \leq c(T)$$
   and we are done.
 \end{proof}
 If a nonterminal is found such that the bound in Theorem \ref{thm:vor:1} is larger than the objective value of
 any found feasible solution, then that nonterminal is redundant and it is valid to remove it and its edges.

 Similar 
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:vor:2}
  Let $T = (V_T, E_T, c, p)$ be a solution to the \gls{pcstp} in the graph $G = (V, E, c, p)$ with terminal set $N$ such that
  $v_k \in V_T$ for some $v_k \in N$ and $V_T \neq \{v_k\}$. Finally, let $v_b \in N$ be the terminal \textit{closest}
  to $v_k$, and let $z'_1, ..., z_{|N|-1}$ be an ordering of the set $N \setminus \{v_k\}$ such that
  $$\pcradius(z_1) \leq ... \leq \pcradius(i) \leq ... \leq \pcradius(z'_{|N|-1})$$
  then we have
  $$d(v_b, v_k) + \sum_{i = 1}^{|N| - 2} \pcradius(z'_i) \leq c(T)\mathnormal{.}$$
\end{theorem}
The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:vor:2} is symmetric to the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:vor:1}. If a terminal is found such that
the respective lower bound is higher than the objective value of a given incumbent, then the terminal is redundant and it is
 valid to remove it from $G$ along with its adjacent edges.

 \subsection{Summary of Usage}\label{sec:pre:summary-usage}
There's a general consensus in literature that preprocessing is an important part of producing solutions
for the \gls{pcstp}. Preprocessing described in this section is applied natively to the \gls{pcstp}
in all of
\cite{lucena2004strong, Ljubic:2004:memetic, ljubic2005solving,akhmedov2016divide,gamrath2017scip}.
Additionally, preprocessing is applied to the \gls{sap} in \cite{leitner2016dual}, and proposed
as further improvements in \cite{fu2014knowledge}.

\paragraph{Combinations of Tests}

In \cite{lucena2004strong} all four of the degree tests (NTD1, NTD2, TD1+UDV, TD2+UDV) are
applied alongside shortest path relaxations of SD and NTDk (for ``small'' numbers of $k$)
tests. They do not
present in which order tests are applied or how often they are repeated, but they
do present the graph sizes of their benchmark cases before and after applying preprocessing.

\cite{Ljubic:2004:memetic} and \cite{ljubic2005solving} share a preprocessing routine
 which applies in order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item degree one tests: NTD1+TD1+UDV,
\item degree two tests: NTD2+TD2.
\item shortest path relaxation of the special distance test (here called the least cost test),
\item shortest path relaxation of NTDk for $k = 3,...,8$, and
\item the minimum adjacency test.
\end{enumerate}
until a fixpoint is reached. They present both numbers on graph reduction and preprocessing
time. Across all problem instances, they report on average
a 45\% reduction in graph size.

\cite{akhmedov2016divide} applies the four degree tests until a fixpoint is reached. They
report reduction in graph sizes for their test cases as well as pre-processing time and
total computation time with/without preprocessing.

\begin{example}
Finally, we'll give an example of the power of
these preprocessing methods. Figure \ref{fig:pre:ex} shows how just
the local tests defined in Section \ref{sec:pre:local} are enough
to solve the -- admittedly simplistic -- instance of the \gls{pcstp}
from Figure \ref{fig:pcstp:01}.

\end{figure}

This example shows how successive application of preprocessing routines can be at
reducing the size of an input graph. These routines have a cascading effect as one
graph reduction makes another one legal. In Figure (\ref{fig:pre:ex}) this comes to
pass when the third reduction -- the \textit{Minimum Adjacency} test -- contracts
the edge between nodes $b$ and $d$, causing the degree of nodes $c$ and $e$ to
 drop to 2, which allows for the fifth and sixth reductions.
\end{example}

It is an open question which selection of graph reduction tests are
 most efficient, and likewise with the ordering of graph reductions.
