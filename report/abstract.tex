The \gls{pcstp} in graphs is an NP-hard optimisation problem which involves
finding a connected subgraph which minimises the total edge cost of
the subgraph summed with all vertex prizes not spanned by the subgraph.
Multiple exact algorithms, approximation algorithms, and heuristics have been defined
for \gls{pcstp}, making it a well researched problem.

In this master's thesis, we present a comprehensive survey of the research landscape
on the \gls{pcstp}. This involves a thorough look at some of the most interesting
and important algorithms for the \gls{pcstp}. Among the surveyed subjects are
powerful preprocessing routines, the widely cited Goemans-Williamson approximation
algorithm, and two state-of-the-art solvers.

We make use of this survey to consider the relation of the \gls{pcstp} and other close
 problems, and take a new look at the younger and much less researched problem, the
\gls{mtp}. This problem is a generalisation of the \gls{pcstp} where instead of paying
static vertex prizes for unspanned vertices, a cost is now paid to \textit{assign}
unspanned vertices to the result subgraph.

For the \gls{mtp} we present a new \acrlong{ilp} formulation as well as a solver which
is able to generate exact solutions to the problem. Furthermore, we present a new
dataset based on previously released datasets for the \gls{pcstp}.
