:END:
- Transform into Steiner Arborescence Problem (directed graph)
- Add root node
- Two arcs for each edge
- Algorithm in short:
  1. Solve LP-relaxtion.
  2. Cut away solutions by iteratively adding constraints based on max flow. 
     (Polynomial time; Goldberg)
- Tested on OR-Library and GIS-DATA
